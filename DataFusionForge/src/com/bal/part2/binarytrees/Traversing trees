Two different approaches for traversing trees. All these approaches are classified in two categories.
  1. Breadth First (also called Level Order traverse)
                (7)             first level: Start at the root our tree
              /     \
            (4)     (9)         second level: 4 and 9
            /  \    /  \
          (1)  (6) (8) (10)     third level: 1, 6, 8, 10

                                We are going to visit our nodes in this order 7, 4, 9, 1, 6, 8, 10

  2. Depth first

             We have three different ways here,
                1. pre-order: Root, Left-subtree and than the Right-subtree
                2. in-order: Left-subtree, Root, Right-subtree
                3. post-order: Left, Right, root

    1. pre-order traversal: start at the root, and print the value of this node.
        Then we got to left-subtree (4) and
          the move to the left(1). That is the single node.
            We have to go back to previous sub tree (4). We have visited the left-subtree,
              its time to visit the right-subtree (6)
                We visited a root on the left-subtree. the right-subtree
                    9
                   /
                  8 -> single
                    9 -> previously node
                     \
                     10 -> right subtree

        In this order: 7, 4, 1, 6, 9, 8, 10

    2. In-order traversal (Left, Root, Right)
      the left-subtree first
        (4)
       /   \
      (1)  (6)

      (1) -> (4) -> (6) -> (7)
      8 -> 9 -> 10

    3. Post-order traversal (Left, right, root)
        left: 1 ->  6 -> 4
        right: 8 -> 10 -> 9
        root: 7
