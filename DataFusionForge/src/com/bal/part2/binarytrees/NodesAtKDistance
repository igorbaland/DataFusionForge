Printing the nodes at a given distance from the route.
    For example, write code to print all nodes with distance 3 from the root

    How to solve this problem?
        Recursion. Breaking this problem down into
            Smaller and easier to solve problems
                distance > 0

                distance = 3


                                20                      //Distance == 3
                    10                      30          //Distance == 2
            6               21          4               //Distance == 1
        3       8                                       //Distance == 0

                                                        //distance == 0, print values of the nodes
