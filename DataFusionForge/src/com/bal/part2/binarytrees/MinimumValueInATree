We are going use recursion. We are gonna break down a large complex problem into bunch of smaller easier to solve
problem.

                    20
        10                          30
    6          21               4
3      8

To find a minimum value in this tree, we should find the minimum in the
 left
 right
   subtrees. Then we will compare those minimum values with the value in the root. In this way, we can find minimum
   in our binary tree
        right subtree
        20
            30
        4
            We are going do this recursively. When it comes to finding the minimum value in the right subtree. We start
            with the leaf node.
