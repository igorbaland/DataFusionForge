Binary tree can only have
  2 x Children
    A node without any children call a
      Leaf.
        height == 0
          As we go up in the tree
            the height increases

    Depth = 0
      As we go in the tree
        the depth increases
          from the root to the leaf



Binary searching tree
  all the values in the left subtree of the nodes
    are smaller
  right subtree
    are greater

Few different algorithms for traversing binary trees. These algorithms in 2 categories:
    1. Breadth
        Level-order
        
    2. Depth First
        Pre-order
            Root, Left, Right
        In-order
            Left, Root, Right
        Post-order
            Left, Right, Root
