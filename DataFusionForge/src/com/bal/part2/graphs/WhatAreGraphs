We use Graph to represent connected objects such as the routers in a network or people on a social media platform.
Using a graph, we can see how people are connected and how strong these connections are.
Just like trees, graph consist of nodes and edges. In fact, mathematically speaking, a tree is a kind a graph without
any cycles.
We don't have a root node.

Here we have a graph with four nodes and six edges (lines). This nodes is also called Vertices, this the plural of
Vertex, vertex is an older term.

    (John) --- (Mary)           () Vertex
     |     \ /   |
     |     / \   |
    (Bob) ---  (Alice)
                    \
                    (Sam)

    These nodes can be connected to any other nodes. We don't have a limitation in terms of how many connections or
    edges we can have for one node. If two nodes are directly connected, we say  they are adjacent or neighbors.
    (John)
        |           Adjacent
    (Bob)

    But John and Sam aren't, because the are not directly connected

If all nodes have a directly edges, we say
  directed graph

  undirected graphs
    are like a facebook and linkedIn. If we add someone as a friend, there will be a line or connection between the two
    of us and this connection doesn't have a direction.

These edges can also have a weight. We use this weight to represent how strong a connection is. For example, on a social
platform, if two interact a lot,  we can put a higher weight on their connection. Later, we can show their best friends
by finding the neighboring node with the highest weights.

Another application of graphs is in finding the shortest path between two nodes. for example, we can use a graph to
represent how different cities or areas are connected. The weight we put on these edges can represent the distance
traveling cost or traffic conditions.
