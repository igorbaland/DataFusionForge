We need to maintain three sets of nodes
    1. all
        to keep track of all nodes in our graph


    2. visiting
        want to store nodes that we are currently visiting


    3. visited
        store the node we have visited

            The difference between the 2. and 3.
              if we visit a node and all of this children, we put it in the visitedSet. But as long as we haven't
              visited all of the children of a node, we are gonna to keep it in the visitingSet.
