Arrays
  simplest data structure
  built into most programming languages
    in some languages like
      JavaScript and Python
        arrays are dynamic
          which means they can grow or shrink automatically
            in Java
              they are static
                Java provides a dynamic array implementation using
                  ArrayList class
                    Each time ArrayList gets full, it will grow
                      by 50% of it's size

Arrays are great when we know ahead of time
  how much things we want to store in them

The runtime complexity of various objects
 Lookup by Index
   O(1)
    Worst case scenario, this item is going to be the last item in array
     Lookup by Value
       O(n)
     Because this item must to be copied to a new array
     Insert
       O(n)
       shifted to the left in case of
         Delete
           O(n)
