    O(2^n)
    Exponential is that an opposite of logarithmic.
        Logarithmic slow down as the input  size grown, but exponential growth faster and faster. All the algorithm
        runs in the exponential type is not scalable at all. They become very slow. We will see the example of
        exponential in the future
