Queues
    BACK       FRONT
        [][][]
  is a data structure, similar to a stack,
    except the first item inserted is the first that can be removed.
      That is what we call
            First-In First-Out (FIFO)

        Stacks on the other hand are
            Last-in First-out (LIFO)

The queueing programming is like line a queue or people at the real world.
  People join the line from the
    back
      and live from the
    front.
  Queues are exactly the same.

We can use queues in situation, where we have a resource and this resource must be
  shared amongst many consumers.
    These consumers should line up  and use the resource
      one by one.

Few Examples

  Operating systems
  Web Servers
  Live support systems

  dequeue
    removing an item at the front of a queue
  peek
    for getting the item at the front without removing it
  isEmpty

  All this operations running
